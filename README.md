QircuitCraft

An interactive and fun application for learning concepts in quantum computing through quiz questions, circuit building, and Bloch sphere exploration. (Installation given below)

Features

1. Quiz Mode
   - The user will be given a question on input qubits reaching a certain output, and they must use the gates given to solve the circuit
   - There is a table-based layout and text-based layout for circuits being built
   - Filedity checks are used to verify answers, and the fidelity values can be seen on the right hand side
   - There is a hint function which visualises the circuit for better understanding
   - For the current version, there are 4 questions in total, but this can easily be scaled up. Users auto-advance to the next question.
2. Bloch Sphere Sandbox Mode
   - As part of the sandbox mode, a Bloch sphere can be utilised to visualise effects of gates on the sphere
   - Currently with this version, only single qubit gates can be applied
   - There is an option to reset for multiple experiments
